Source code of LFN Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each tool is a monolithic app. The LFN Library (lfn.cpp) is #included by each app.
It's certainly not ANSI C, I know.
You may see weird things like: ((void*)&((char*)DATA[j])[i*sbpc]) , I know that sometime I
should make this a bit nicer.
Some functions (i.e. FindMask) may have a complicated behaviour. Try to understand them.
Some functions (i.e. SeekPath) can be abused to serve a specific task. See the apps for
deeper understanding.
The CD-ROM support required some work-arounds, which slightly messed up the code. Sorry.

When building, mind the stack size (I used 24 kB) and use LARGE model!
Keep in mind that this is 16-bit code, that does not use Windows.
I used MS-VC++ 1.51 to compile. If you can not compile it using your favourite compiler I can not help you. This is considered as YOUR problem.

vmemory.h / .lib
This is a Microsoft library that ships with MS-VC++. Due to (c) I can not provide this library.
It is *not* enough to have the header file. You need the library file to link.
If you do not have the library comment out the #define VMEMORY in lfn.cpp. This prevents the VCache from
beeing compiled into the binary.
